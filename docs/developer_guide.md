## Set up the Development Environment

The [tests](#run-the-tests) in this guide are written in Python. Therefore, to complete the functional tests, you must have Python 3.6 - 3.8 installed. 

In this guide you:

## Prepare Environment to Use the Tests <a name="test-prep"></a>

### Step 1: Compile source code
1. Build the development `openvino/model_server-build` Docker* image
   ```bash
   make docker_build 
   or
   make docker_build DLDT_PACKAGE_URL=<URL>
   ```
   Note: URL to OpenVINO Toolkit package can be received after registration on [OpenVINOâ„¢ Toolkit website](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/choose-download)
   
2. Mount the source code in the Docker container:
	```bash
	docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/ovms --entrypoint bash -p 9178:9178 openvino/model_server-build:latest 
	```

3. In the docker container context compile the source code via:
	```bash
	bazel build //src:ovms
	```

4. From the container, run a single unit test:
	```bash
	bazel test --test_summary=detailed --test_output=all --test_filter='ModelVersionStatus.*' //src:ovms_test
	```

	where:

	* `test` - builds and runs the specified test target
	* `--test_summary=detailed` - the output includes failure information 
	* `--test_output=all` - log all tests
	* `--test_filter='ModelVersionStatus.*'` - limits the tests run to the indicated test 
	* `//src:ovms_test` - the test source

	For more information, see the [bezel command-line reference](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html)
	
5. Select one of these options to change the target image name or network port to be used in tests. It might be helpful on a shared development host:

	* With a Docker cache:
	
	```bash
	OVMS_CPP_DOCKER_IMAGE=<unique_image_name> make docker_build
    OVMS_CPP_DOCKER_IMAGE=<unique_image_name> make test_functional
    OVMS_CPP_CONTAINTER_PORT=<unique_network_port> make test_perf
	```

	* Without a Docker cache:

	```bash
	make NO_DOCKER_CACHE=true
	```


### Step 2: Install software

1. Install Python release 3.6 through 3.8.
 
**NOTE**: Python is only necessary to complete the functional tests in this guide.

2. Install the `virtualenv` package:

	```
	pip3 install virtualenv
	```

You're ready to run the tests. 

## Run the Tests <a name="test-run"></a>

Use the tests below that are the best for your circumstances. If you have problems, see the <a href="#debug">debugging section</a>. Click the test you want to run:

<details><summary>How to test inference</summary>

1. Download an exemplary model [ResNet50-binary model](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/omz_models_intel_resnet50_binary_0001_description_resnet50_binary_0001.html):

	```
	tests/performance/download_model.sh
	```

	The script stores the model in the user home folder. 

2. Start OVMS docker container with downloaded model

```bash
docker run -d -v ~/resnet50-binary:/models/resnet50-binary -p 9178:9178 openvino/model_server:latest \
--model_name resnet-binary --model_path /models/resnet50-binary --port 9178
```

3. The grpc client connects to the OpenVINO Model Server service that is running on port 9178.

	```bash
	make venv
	source .venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r example_client/client_requirements.txt
	python3 tests/performance/grpc_latency.py --images_numpy_path tests/performance/imgs.npy --labels_numpy_path tests/performance/labels.npy \
	--iteration 1000 --model_name resnet-binary --batchsize 1 --report_every 100 --input_name 0 --output_name 1463 --grpc_port 9178
	```

Where:

* `images_numpy_path tests/performance/imgs.npy` - the path to a numpy array. `imgs.npy` is the numpy array with a batch of input data.
* `labels_numpy_path tests/performance/labels.npy` - include a numpy array  named labels.npy. This array has image classification results with which the test dataset measures accuracy.
* `iteration 1000` - run the data 1000 times
* `batchsize 1` - batch size to be used in the inference request
* `report_every 10` - number of iterations followed by results summary report
* `input_name 0` - name of the deployed model input called "0"
* `output_name 1463` - name of the deployed model output called "1463"

</details>

<details><summary>How to run functional tests</summary>

The functional tests are written in Python. Therefore, to complete the tests in this section, you must have Python 3.6 - 3.8 installed. If you have trouble with these test, see the <a href="#debug">debugging section</a>.

```bash
make test_functional
``` 

Configuration options are:

* `IMAGE` - Docker image name for the tests.
* `TEST_DIR_CACHE` - Location from which models and test data are downloaded.
* `TEST_DIR` - Location to which models and test data are copied during tests.
* `TEST_DIR_CLEANUP` - Set to `True` to remove the directory under `TEST_DIR` after the tests.
* `LOG_LEVEL` - The log level.
* `BUILD_LOGS` - Path to save artifacts.
* `START_CONTAINER_COMMAND` - The command to start the OpeVINO Model Storage container.
* `CONTAINER_LOG_LINE` - The log line in the container that confirms the container started properly.

Add any configuration variables to the command line in this format:

```bash
export IMAGE="openvino/model_server:latest"
```

To make command repetition easier, create and store the configuration options in a file named `user_config.py`. Put this file in the main project directory.

Example:

```bash
os.environ["IMAGE"] = "openvino/model_server"
```

Automated tests are configured to use the ResNet50 model.

<details><summary>How to run tests on an OpenVINO Model Server binary file</summary>

To run tests on an OpenVINO Model Server binary file, use export to specify the following variable in `user_config.py` or in the environment. 
Replace `"/home/example_path/ovms/bin/ovms"` with the path to your binary file:

```
os.environ["OVMS_BINARY_PATH"] = "/home/example_path/ovms/bin/ovms"
```

The following command executed in the of OpenVINO Model Server binary file should return paths to the unpacked `lib` directory included in `ovms.tar.gz` (`ovms/bin/./../lib`).
```
ldd ./ovms
```

Otherwise use export to specify the following variable in `user_config.py` file or in the environment:

```
os.environ["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"] = "<path to ovms libraries>"
```

## Debugging <a name="debug"></a>

Two debugging options are available. Click the option you need to use:

<details><summary>How to use `gdb` to debug in Docker</summary>

1. Build a project in a debug mode:
	```
	make docker_build BAZEL_BUILD_TYPE=dbg
	```

2. Run the container:
	```
	docker run -it --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -v ${PWD}:/ovms -p 9178:9178 --entrypoint bash openvino/model_server-build:latest
	```
3.	Recompile the OpenVINO Model Server with debug symbols. For best results use the makefile parameter `BAZEL_BUILD_TYPE=dbg` to also build the dependencies in debug mode:
	```
	[root@72dc3b874772 ovms]# bazel build //src:ovms -c dbg
	[root@72dc3b874772 ovms]# gdb --args ./bazel-bin/src/ovms --model_name resnet --model_path /model
	```

For unit test debugging:
	```
	gdb --args ./bazel-bin/src/./ovms_test --gtest_filter='OvmsConfigTest.emptyInput'
	```

Enable fork follow mode when debugging forking tests:
	```
	# (in gdb cli)
	set follow-fork-mode child
	```
</details>
<details><summary>How to debug functional tests</summary>

Use OpenVINO Model Server build image because it installs the necessary tools.

1. Add the ENTRYPOINT line in Dockerfile.centos to:
	```
	ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep 3600; echo 'Server started on port'; sleep 100000"]
	```

2. Build the project in debug mode:
	```
	make docker_build BAZEL_BUILD_TYPE=dbg
	```

3. Open a terminal.

4. Run a test in this terminal. Change `TEST_PATH` to point to the test you want to debug:
	```
	TEST_PATH=tests/functional/test_batching.py::TestBatchModelInference::test_run_inference_rest IMAGE=openvino/model_server-build:latest make test_functional
	```
	
5. Open a second terminal.

6. In this terminal identify the ID/hash of a running Docker container:
	```
	docker ps
	```

7. Use the ID to execute a new bash shell into this container and start gdb. Make sure the parameters you pass to the OpenVINO Model Server match the parameters in the test code:
	```
	docker exec -ti HASH bash
	[root@898d55a2aa56 src]# cd /ovms/bazel-bin/src/ ; gdb --args ./ovms  --model_name age_gender --model_path /opt/ml/age_gender --port 9000 --rest_port 5500 --log_level TRACE
	```

8. Open a third terminal.

9. In this terminal use the Docker container ID/hash to stop the sleep process that is preventing the tests from starting. These tests are waiting for stdout text "Server started on port":
	```
	docker exec -ti HASH bash
	[root@898d55a2aa56 src]# yum install psmisc
	...
	[root@898d55a2aa56 src]# killall sleep
	```

10. Return to the first terminal to debug the test execution.
